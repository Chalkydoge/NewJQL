In this archive, a reference architecture is provided in two styles:

- In the [`myjql`](./myjql) directory, the `*.c` and the `*.h` files compose the program. Supplied with [`Makefile`](./myjql/Makefile), you can run `make` in the shell to directly compile the program.

- [`myjql.c`](./myjql.c) is the all-in-one source code, you can use `gcc` to compile it. (The second line contains the complete command for compilation)

These styles are both acceptable. Do remember to submit a `README(.md|.txt)` (telling the way to compile the source code, like [this](./myjql/README.md)), if the first style is used.
